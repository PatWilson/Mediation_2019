# What is Mediation Analyses?


---
## Background  
--

- Mediation seeks to describe the *mechanism* by which a cause affects an outcome

--

- In this model, an intervention is theorized to affect an outcome through another variable known as a mediator

--

- One can then decompose intervention effects into two pathways:
 1. Through changing the mediator which changes the outcome **(indirect effect)** 
 2. Through some other mechanism **(direct effect)**

--

- Formalized in Baron & Kenny (1986) with linear regression 


---
## Causal Mediation Analyses

--

- Greenland, Robins, and Pearl formulated causal mediation analyses and developed the causal equivalent of direct and indirect effects.

--

- Makes sense to try to measure mediation through a potential outcome or counterfactual framework

--

- As a "general" method it surpasses the Baron and Kenny approach with respect to interactions and nonlinearities

--

- Also additional assumptions are needed with mediation analyses, so the ability to encode confounding control in a straightforward way is critically important

# What kind of questions can you ask?

class: middle, center 
## Example (Depression)

> *A randomized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention estimates an effect on depression symptoms after 3 months of follow up. However, investigators noticed that the intervention increased the use of antidepressants. Did CBT work on depressive symptoms because it led to antidepressant adherence or did CBT affect depressive symptoms through other pathways?*

## Example (Genetic Epidemiology) 

> *Research has found associations between genetic variants on chromosome 15q25.1 and lung cancer. These variants were also known to be associated with smoking. Not only was there a hypothesis of mediation but also that the variant may increase indivduals' vulnerability to the harmful effect of smoking (gene-environment interaction).*

# Causal Estimands and DAGs 

---
## The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("mediation_triangle.png")
```

---
## Regression

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("mediation_triangle.png")
```


- Consists of two regression models. A mediator $M$ model and outcome $Y$ model for an intervention $a$ adjusted by a covariate or set of covariates $c$.


$$E(M|a,c) = \beta_0 + \beta_1a + \beta_2c$$


$$E(Y|m,a,c) = \theta_0 + \theta_1a + \theta_2m + \theta_3c$$

Where $\theta_1$ is the "direct" effect and $\beta_1*\theta_2$ is the "indirect" effect




---
##Interpretation

--

- The three primary estimands of interest are the controlled direct effect (CDE), natural direct effect (NDE), and natural indirect effect (NIE). 

--

- We will use the potential outcome framework to demonstrate. Briefly, for a particular intervention $A$, $Y_{a}$ is the outcome if $A$ were set to $a$

--

- For causal mediation this outcome is further extended to incorporate a mediator, $M$
  
$$Y_{a=a,m=m}$$ 
  


---
##Controlled Direct Effect 


How much the outcome would change on average if the mediator were fixed at level $m$ uniformly in the population but the treatment were changed from level $a^*=0$ to $a=1$ 

$$E(Y_{a=1,m=m} - Y_{a=0,m=m})$$

In layman's terms:

*What is the effect of intervention, if we intervened to set the mediator to a certain level?*

---
##Natural Direct Effect

How much the outcome would change if the exposure were set at level $a=1$ vs. $a^*=0$  but for each individual the mediator were kept at the level it would have taken, for that individual in the absence of the exposure.

$$E(Y_{a=1,~m=M_0} - Y_{a=0,~m=M_0})$$

In layman's terms: 

*If we set the mediator to control levels what intervention effect would we see?*

---
## Natural Indirect Effect


How much the outcome would change on average if the exposure were fixed at level $a=1$ but the mediator were changed from the level it would take if $a=0$ to the level it would take if $a=1$


$$E(Y_{a=1,~m=M_1} - Y_{a=1,~m=M_0})$$

In layman's terms: 

*What is the effect of the intervention by changing the mediator?*


---
## Derivative Measures

--

- Total effect

$$TE = NDE + NIE$$
--

- Proportion mediated

$$PM = \frac{NIE}{TE}$$

--

- Proportion Eliminated

$$PE(m) = \frac{TE - CDE(m)}{TE}$$

# Implementation of Mediation 

---
##Implementation

--
1. Regression Analytic Approach

 + Extending the Baron and Kenny method
 + Can handle survival analyses, and binary/count data
 + Requires complex formulas for standard errors or Bootstrap

--
2. Simulation Approach

  + Fit models for the observed outcome and mediator variables.
  + Simulate model parameters from their sampling distribution.
  + Simulate potential outcomes
  + Compute the causal mediation effects.


--
3. Bayesian Approach

  + Principled approach
  + Extremely Flexible
  + Need to build fully generative model

---
## Assessing Mediation

--

- In which scenario should you adjust for Z? Both? Neither?

--

- One wouldn't adjust if it is a mediator but you would adjust of a confounder 

--

- How do you tell? 

--

- Even if you or your investigator is not interested in Mediation *per se* you could be adjusting for a variable that is on the pathway and therefore creating a biased estimate of your effect



---
## Some Good Rules of Thumb

--

- Study design and the paramount importance of time


--

- Measuring distinct constructs


--

- Causal discovery and exacerbation of the fishing problem
